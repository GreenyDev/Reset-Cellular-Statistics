Automatically resets the Cellular Statistics (Settings > Mobile/Cellular) on a monthly, weekly or daily basis!

Originally, this tweak is released by greenywd.
CokePokes added iOS9-11 support on his folked version. (It's not open source contrary to the license though)
I have added an support for iOS12 and iOS13 (and arm64e).
